00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:39,375
Who knows? No one knows.
I don't even know. I can't see. Where?

165
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,166
And I know. I know fantasy's fun,
fantasy's really fun.

166
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,958
But right now, I need you to
pull yourself together and join reality.

167
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,375
KAMALA: <i>You know, the plan was perfect.</i>
<i>I was gonna get my license.</i>

168
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,833
Then under the cover of stupid
wedding errands, we just have, like,

169
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,166
one pure, beautiful day of freedom
at AvengerCon.

170
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,750
-Guess there's always next year.
-No, there's no next year.

171
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,333
This is the first one ever.
And then future historians,

172
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:11,291
they're gonna start writing about it,
and where does it start? Here.

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,583
Okay? There's not gonna be another
first AvengerCon ever again. Never.

174
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,291
-Switch to the back-up plan then.
-You have a back-up plan?

175
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,750
What's... What's your back-up plan?

176
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,875
In concept, it is pretty easy.

177
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,000
But it's gonna take a lot of finesse
and subtlety on your part.

178
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,500
And you just aren't...

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,041
-I can be subtle.
-You can be subtle?

180
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:40,083
Okay. Listen, you enter your home,
you sit down at the dinner table,

181
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,791
smile, and you ask your mom.

182
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,125
-You're an idiot.
-I'm not. I'm actually a genius.

183
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,250
So, can we stop acting
like your mom is Darth Vader?

184
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,250
Every single thing I love,
she seems to hate.

185
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,458
And it's like she thinks I'm some kind of,
you know, weirdo.

186
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,708
You are a weirdo. Whoa!

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,166
What?

188
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,708
If I'm weird, you're weirder.

189
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:05,083
I know. But more importantly,
I've gotten weirdly good at airbrushing.

190
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,250
I put the rest of it together, but okay.

191
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,000
-So...
-You think we'll win?

192
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,166
KAMALA: Please.
We're going, we're conquering.

193
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,125
And we're high-fiving in slow motion.

194
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,291
Bruno, I still need to figure out
my final flourish for my costume.

195
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,125
-Any ideas?
-BRUNO: Okay.

196
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,000
How about steampunk Captain Marvel?

197
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,041
-Steampunk is dead.
-Okay, fine.

198
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,666
How about a mashup?
Like Captain Panther or Iron Marvel?

199
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,833
Ooh, Doctor Strange Marvel.
I can, like, wear a cape.

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,416
-BRUNO: Capes are cool.
-Even Asgardian.

201
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,958
You know, be like a badass Valkyrie,
ride a horse.

202
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,875
I can't build you a horse,
but otherwise...

203
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,083
You can build me sloth baby wings.
That's very me.

204
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,958
Completely you. Wings, a little tiara.

205

-BOY: Playing here.
-Captain Princess Marvel.

206
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,541
No princesses. I'm sorry.
You know what's even better?

207
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,125
-What?
-Zombie Captain Marvel.

208
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:54,083
I could be like, "I'll eat your brains.
But I also have super powers."

209
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,958
Okay. Hey, let's never do
that zombie impersonation again.

MUNEEBA: Hi, Kamala <i>beta.</i> How are you?
Hmm? How was school?

211
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,250
Apparently I have four days to
figure out my whole future, so that's...

212
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,500

Why'd she also send all this junk?

217
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,333
I'd like to tell you
that it's because she's growing old,

218
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,250
but she's always been this way.

219
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,416
She doesn't want to die
before passing on all her junk to us.

220
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,708
Aamir, have you lost your ears?

221
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,916
This is so cool. Is this <i>Nani's?</i>

222
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:49,375
That is junk.

223
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,458
Aamir, here. Take this
and put it in the attic right now,

224
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,333
and then unpack the groceries.

225
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,958
-Why can't Kamala do it?
-She's going to help me with my errands.

-You know the ones for your wedding?
-I am?

Oi, what happened?

248
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,833
She decided that she wasn't
ready for commitment.

249
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:20,000
So now she's off gallivanting
through Europe to "discover" herself.

I mean, she wanted to travel the world
and she went for it. So that's cool.

So this is a security camera, okay?
So you can see who's home from your phone.

-From my phone?
-Oh, yeah, from your phone.
