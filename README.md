# Subtitle Merger

This program will merged two subtitles into a single files. You could download open-source subtitles [here](https://subscene.com/). I write this program without any external library of Python. There are many improvements you could give to this project, feel free to contact me if you want. 


Note: 
* The file that can be merged using this program must be in  `.srt` format. 
* This program could be run in `Python 3.x`
## Documentation

Here is the step to use the program. Prepare your original subtitle and the second subtitle. Run the program. 

```cmd
D:\code\subtitle_merger> python app.py
```

The program will ask you three questions.
```cmd
Subtitle 1: {original_subtitle}
Subtitle 2: {second_subtitle}
Output (Default: combined.srt): 
```

If you put the output without any name, it will creating the merged subtitle with title `combined.srt`.

Enjoy!!!
